                    Eraserheads is a Filipino alternative rock band formed in 1989. With a line-up composing of Ely Buendia (vocals & guitar), Buddy Zabala (bass), Marcus Adoro (lead guitar), and Raimund Marasigan (drums), the band became one of the most influential and successful in the history of Filipino music. Often dubbed as "The Beatles of the Philippines", they are credited for spearheading a second wave of Manila band invasions, paving the way for a host of Filipino alternative rock bands.
                    The band released several singles, albums, and EPs. They achieved commercial success with their third album Cutterpillow (1995), which achieved platinum status several times. They also received the Viewer's Choice Award at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards in New York, the only Filipino artist to have received the award before the conception of the MTV Asia Awards. In 2002, the band officially disbanded as the vocalist Ely Buendia left the group.
